When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

One reason to use a remote repository would be for backup. If something happens to your
local computer and you can't access your repository, you would still be able to get to your work
on the remote reposirtory.
Another reason to use remote repository is if your are working from two different computers, or
with more people.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

If Git automatically did periodic updating from the remote repository, you could
lose everything your worked on up to that point if you hadn't previously pushed
it into the remote.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you
use one instead of another?

A clone is a copy of a repository that is on a local machine. So far, we've only
dealt with clones in the way that we make a clone from github onto our local
machine, but it is possible to make a clone of a repository on the same machine.
A fork is clone, but it is a repository of another's github work into your
github and it generally tracks the changes you've made since you created the
fork. You can add collaborators to the fork, though.
A branch is a part of a repository wherein the commits "branch" off from one
another. There is almost always a "master" branch, which contains the most
up-to-date official commit. a common use for branches is to keep your master
for debugging (if that) and work out/add in new features on a different branch.
