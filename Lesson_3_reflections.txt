When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

One reason to use a remote repository would be for backup. If something happens to your
local computer and you can't access your repository, you would still be able to get to your work
on the remote reposirtory.
Another reason to use remote repository is if your are working from two different computers, or
with more people.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

If Git automatically did periodic updating from the remote repository, you could
lose everything your worked on up to that point if you hadn't previously pushed
it into the remote.
