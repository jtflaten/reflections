When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

One reason to use a remote repository would be for backup. If something happens to your
local computer and you can't access your repository, you would still be able to get to your work 
on the remote reposirtory. 
Another reason to use remote repository is if your are working from two different computers, or 
with more people.
